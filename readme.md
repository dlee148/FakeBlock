> "It's like blocking someone, but with social grace" -my mom

The status quo of the social media age:

1. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer
2. Don't burn bridges if you don't have to

This isn't always easy. Sure, your friend from high school works at that sleek new startup that you've had your eye on for a long time,
but he's also a flaming [.\*]-ist with strong opinions.
With every disparaging article he shares, your desire to cut him off grows.
But where is the "social grace" in that? Blocking, un-friending, or unfollowing, while 100% effective, are all non-transparent actions when it comes down to it. Can you smell the bridges burning? You want a way to remove these nuisances from your social media experience, without the hassle and discomfort.  

This is where __FakeBlock__ comes in.  

FakeBlock is a new Chrome extension that allows you to remove all traces of any number of individuals from your social feeds with the click of a button.
